			About the Project
			</h1>
			<p>
				This is a tower defense style game with a few unique twists and an undead/fantasy theme.
				The game was written as a capstone project for the CIS499 course at Lander University. The game 
				features real-time co-operative multiplayer where two players work together to defend
				their base from attacking zombies by placing and upgrading various defensive "towers" on the map.
				The game requires a certain amount of strategy and teamwork between players. It features a 
				live chat system to facilitate this teamwork. The game, like most tower defense games, has
				the players attempt to survive as long as possible against un-ending waves of ever increasingly
				stronger enemies. Players who manage to survive long enough will have their names and stats recorded
				on a leaderboard on this webiste's highscores page.

				Technology
			</h1>
			<p>
				The game is written in primarily in JavaScript using the P5 library, and the node.js 
				runtime. MongoDB is leveraged for the leaderboard functionality and simple HTML/CSS is
				used for the website. The game uses a client/server architecture with a primary
				matchmaking server connecting players to the game before spawning an instance of a game server
				for the match to take place in. (see diagram below) This allows a single matchmaking server to be available for 
				creating player connections and the multiple game servers to be istatiated and destroyed as
				needed.
