		<h1>
			Getting Started
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Joining the Game
		</h2>
		<p>
			To join a game, navigate to the "Game" page on the website. The game
			will load automatically and place you into a lobby. If you are the
			first player in the lobby you must wait for a second player to connect.
			If you are the second player in a lobby the game will start automatically
			once both players have entered a username.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Choosing a Username
		</h2>
		<p>
			Upon connecting to a lobby, you will be prompted to enter a username.
			You may choose any username you like so long as it does not contain profanity
			or exceed 8 characters. Once a username is chosen all high scores earned
			will be tied to that username.
		</p>
		<img src="./images/username.png" alt="username.png" title="Username entry box" class="centered img">
		<h2>
			Using Game Chat
		</h2>
		<p>
			While in the lobby and during game play you will have access to game chat.
			This will be located to the right of the HUD and allow you to
			communicate with your teammate. To send a message simply click to select
			the text field, then type your message. Once your message is ready you can
			send it by pressing the "Enter" key or click the "Send" button to the right
			of the text field.
		</p>

		<h2>
			UI and Game Elements
		</h2>
		<p>
			The UI is split into three main areas:
		</p>
		<img src="./images/ui.png" alt="ui.png" title="The user interface" class="centered img">
		<ol>
			<li>
				Play Field
				<p>
					The play field is where all the action take place. This is where
					you will build, upgrade, and destroy your towers during the build
					phase, and where the zombies will assault your fortifications
					during the attack phase.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				HUD
				<p>
					The HUD is where action and information items live. At the top of
					the HUD you will find build icons for the various tower types
					available to you. If a build icon is greyed out it means that you
					don’t have enough gold to purchase a tower of that type, or that
					tower type is not currently available to you.
				</p>
				<img src="./images/hud.png" alt="hud.png" title="HUD icons" class="centered img">
				<p>
					Below the build icons you will find the tower management buttons.
					Selecting one of these will let you destroy or upgrade towers
					respectively.
				</p>
				<img src="./images/buildIcons.png" alt="buildIcons.png" title="Build Icons" class="centered img">
				<p>
					Next you will find the phase timer. This displays the time remaining
					in the current phase of gameplay as well as the current wave.
				</p>
				<img src="./images/timer.png" alt="timer.png" title="Game Timer" class="centered img">
				<p>
					Finally at the very bottom of the HUD is your gold counter. This displays
					the amount of gold you have earned in battle that can be used for upgrading
					and purchasing new towers.
				</p>
				<img src="./images/gold.png" alt="gold.png" title="Gold Counter" class="centered img">
			</li>
			<li>
				Game Chat
				<p>
					The game chat is to the far right of the screen, and simply displays messages
					sent and received between players.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>
			Towers
		</h2>
		<p>
			There are 4 different towers in the game. Each type of tower attacks in
			a unique way. These towers can also be upgraded to improve their speed,
			 range, and power.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Magic Tower </li>
			<img src="./images/MagicT.png" alt="MagicT.png" title="Magic Tower" class="small img" >
			<li> Gas Tower </li>
			<img src="./images/GasT.png" alt="GasT.png" title="Gas Tower" class="small img">
			<li> Ice Tower </li>
			<img src="./images/IceT.png" alt="IceT.png" title="Ice Tower" class="small img">
			<li> Fire Tower </li>
			<img src="./images/FireT.png" alt="FireT.png" title="Fire Tower" class="small img">
		<h2>
			The Enemy
		</h2>
		<p>
			Rival necromancers have sent their minions to attack your seat of power
			and destroy you! Fend off their attacks by summoning necromantic towers
			anf defeat the encroaching zombies. These ghoulish fiends gladly march 
			straight at your defenses and make a beeline for your stronghold!
		</p>
		<img src="./images/zomb.png" alt="zomb.png" title="The Enemy!" class="centered img">
		<h1>
			Build Phase
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Placing Towers
		</h2>
		<p>
			To place a tower, you must first select the build icon for the type of
			tower you would like to build from the HUD to the right of the play area.
			Build icons that are greyed out can not be selected due to lack of funds.
			After selecting a build icon, you are free to place that tower anywhere in
			the play area that isn’t already occupied by another object. You can build
			as many towers as you like until you run out of gold.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Destroying Towers
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you’ve placed a tower in the wrong spot or would simply like to recoup
			some gold for different towers you can do so by destroying towers. To do
			this you must first select the "Destroy Tower" icon. After this, any active
			towers you click on in the play area will be destroyed and the gold returned
			to your total.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Upgrading Towers
		</h2>
		<p>
			As the game progresses the enemies will get stronger and greater in numbers.
			You will need to upgrade your towers to keep up! Each tower can be upgraded
			a total of ten times. Each upgrade will increase tower stats such as range,
			fire rate, and damage per shot. This will be critical in keeping up with the
			growing threat!
		</p>
		<h1>
			Attack Phase
		</h1>
		<p>
			After the build phase timer depletes the attack phase will begin automatically.
			During this phase enemies will enter the screen from the left and right sides
			and attempt to make it to your base in the center of the screen. Any towers within
			range of the enemies will automatically track and shoot them until they move out
			of range. If enemies make it to your base you will lose hit points. If you lose
			too many hit points you will lose the game. While there isn’t anything to control
			during the attack phase it's crucial that you pay attention to the action to see
			where your weaknesses might lie. This is a good time to make use of the game chat
			to strategize with your team mate and plan out your actions for the next build phase.
		</p>
		<img src="./images/AttackPhase.png" alt="AttackPhase.png" title="Attack Phase" class="centered img">
		<h1>
			Post-Game and Highscores
		</h1>
		<p>
			Once all of your hit points are depleted the game will automatically end and your final
			score for the game will be displayed. The score is determined by the wave you made it to,
			in addition to a number of of factors such as final gold count. If you manage to make a 
			high score it will be displayed on the high scores page of the website along with you and 
			your teammate’s usernames.
